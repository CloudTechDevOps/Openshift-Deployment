# Project Overview

This repository is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose for deployment, CI/CD, and monitoring.

## Directory Structure

- **CICD/**
  - Contains CI/CD pipeline configurations (e.g., `hotstar-pipeline.yaml`).
  - Use these files with your CI/CD tool to automate build and deployment processes.

- **FULLSTACK-DEPLOYMENT/**
  - Contains build and deployment configurations for the full stack application (e.g., `build.yaml`, `dc.yaml`).
  - Use these files to build and deploy the application using your preferred orchestration or CI/CD tool.

- **MONITORING/**
  - Contains monitoring and observability configurations (e.g., `kibana-deploy.yaml`).
  - Use these files to deploy monitoring tools like Kibana to your cluster or monitoring stack.
